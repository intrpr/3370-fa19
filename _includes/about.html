<h3>About This Course</h3>
<p class="lead">This course is an introduction to the process and skills required to produce unidirectional signed-to-spoken English language interpretations between Deaf and nondeaf people. Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>incorporate practical applications of non-judgmental language (Colonomos, Witter-Merrithew, et al.) in evaluating personal and colleague work product</li>
    <li>identify and incorporate a best-practice taxonomy of competencies and processes required to produce sign-to-spoken language interpretations</li>
    <li>demonstrate and self-monitor basic abilities required to create sign-to-spoken language interpretations of rehearsed and/or spontaneous texts:
    <ul>
        <li>understand how principles of the Demand-Control Schema (<abbr>DC-S</abbr>) can undergird ethical and best-practice interpreting decisions</li>
        <li>increase competent usage of spoken English as source (sL) and target language (tL)</li>
        <li>describe and apply the cognitive tasks of pegging, chunking, linking, and monitoring to understand a discourse</li>
        <li>understand how dual-tasking and cognitive load theory impacts spoken language interpretation</li>
        <li>incorporate practical applications of non-judgemental language (Colonomos, Witter-Merrithew, et al.) in personal and colleague work product</li>
        <li>recognize and produce equivalent spoken interpretations given variations in features and parts of message (register, tone, affect, voice, power/less language (Morgan, in Hauser 2008)</li>
        <li>understand and develop practical skills for working in a team dynamic</li>
        <li>recognize and properly address language difference in various genres (comedy, dramatic, age-appropriate, academic, legal, medical, literary/poetic, religious, entertainment, etc.) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>identify impacts on and incorporation of semantic choice, register, and ethical behavioral decisions in consecutive interpretations</li>
    <li>Demonstrate and apply best practice principles in team interpreting work (feeding, assisting, providing feedback, handling logistics)</li>
</ol>
<p>A significant portion of this course requires self-directed efforts (asychronously working with other teammates) and fairly good command of web-based technologies and learning environments (video creation, salient discussion, and reporting skills; weâ€™ll discuss this more in class).</p>
<p><strong>This course requires a one-hour per week lab criteria</strong>; students should expect to spend at least an hour a week on skill-building exercises in a language laboratory setting.</p>
