## There is no I in team

<p class="lead">in 2013, Nicodemus & Emmorey concluded that “bimodal interpreters receive significantly more training and practice working from English into ASL.” Arguably even <em>less</em> studied, much less practiced, is understanding how we work with colleagues in teams. Because not all interpreters and interpretations are alike, our expectations are idiosyncratic: we need to be not only mentally (linguistically) but also socially and emotionally stable and prepared to work with others in producing interpretations and transliterations. Intepreting is a <em>public</em> activity; it’s done in the company of others.</p>

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* This is **not** a comprehensive semester/career-long overview of how to work with teammates; we will work together to identify some universal principles, but how do I continue my study into best teaming practices?
* Considering [the Demand-Control Schema (DC-S) as a framework](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/deaf-wellness-center/demand-control-schema.aspx) (interpersonal demands), in analyzing ourselves and our work colleagues, am I introverted or extroverted? How do I deal with pressure on my personal space? What is the language of critique to which I respond best? How do I react to power/solidarity moves?
* What is the language and grammar of teaming? How should we approach each other for logistical mediation in our work environments?: Does s/he want me to sit close or far far away? Should I whisper or wave? 
* What cultural and value considerations should I think about when I work with teammates that approach work and work language different than I do?
