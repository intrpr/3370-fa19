## There is no I in team

<p class="lead">Nicodemus & Emmorey (2013) concluded that “bimodal interpreters receive significantly more training and practice working from English into ASL.” Arguably even <em>less</em> studied, much less practiced, is understanding how we work with colleagues in teams. Because not all interpreters and interpretations are alike, our expectations are idiosyncratic: we need to be not only mentally (linguistically) but also socially and emotionally stable and prepared to work with others in producing interpretations and transliterations. Interpreting is a <em>public</em> activity; it’s done in the company of others.</p>

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* This is **not** a comprehensive semester/career-long overview of how to work with teammates; we will work together to identify some universal principles, but how do I continue my study into best teaming practices?
* Considering [the Demand-Control Schema (DC-S) as a framework](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/deaf-wellness-center/demand-control-schema.aspx) (interpersonal demands), in analyzing ourselves and our work colleagues, am I introverted or extroverted? How do I deal with pressure on my personal space? What is the language of critique to which I respond best? How do I react to power/solidarity moves?
* What is the language and grammar of teaming? How should we approach each other for logistical mediation in our work environments? Does s/he want me to sit close or far far away? Should I whisper or wave? 
* What cultural and value considerations should I think about when I work with teammates that approach work and work language different than I do?

### What are we doing?
This is a two-part experimental and organic format to incorporate best practice teaming skills into our work. Participation and improved interpreting skills are the reward for this exercise.

There are a fair amount of readings that we’ll parse here; you’ll want to make sure you set aside enough time (you have at least the weekend, if not the week before) to read, skim, and annotate. 

On the first day, the goal is to **present our findings to each other from the assigned readings**: what did you/we find in the resources that are best practices for teaming, what does teaming look like, what are some of the requirements for effective teaming relationships, etc. 

On the second day, after gathering and gleaning what we think are best practices and principles from the resources, we’ll get into groups and, based on a demand-control schema framework (working a problem, rather than ticking a checklist) **[create rubrics or heuristics](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-heuristic-2795235)** that we’ll incorporate in our interpreting work during the rest of the semester.
